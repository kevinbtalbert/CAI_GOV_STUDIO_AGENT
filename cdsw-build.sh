# This cdsw-build.sh file will only be used when we are running in an 
# environment with custom model root dirs disabled. Because composable
# amps and AI Studios are enabled under the same entitlement, in our current
# state we will never hit this if agent-studio/ directory exists, because the
# existence of that directory implies the ML_ENABLE_COMPOSABLE_AMPS entitlement
# as well as the model root dir feature, are both available.

# That being said, just in case this specific model root dir feature is ever moved
# way from the entitlement separately from the rest of the AI Studios features, we
# need to make sure that we explicitly still check for the existence of the folder.
